# NeuralDBG

A causal inference engine for deep learning training that provides **structured explanations** of neural network training failures. Understand *why* your model failed during training through semantic analysis and abductive reasoning, not raw tensor inspection.

## Overview

NeuralDBG treats training as a **semantic trace of learning dynamics** rather than a black box. It extracts meaningful events and provides causal hypotheses about training failures, enabling researchers to:

- **Identify gradient health transitions** (stable → vanishing/saturated)
- **Detect activation regime shifts** (normal → saturated/dead)
- **Track propagation of instabilities** through network layers
- **Generate ranked causal explanations** for training failures

Unlike traditional monitoring tools (TensorBoard, Weights & Biases), NeuralDBG focuses on **causal inference** rather than metric tracking.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Event Extraction**: Detects meaningful transitions in training dynamics
- **Causal Compression**: Identifies first occurrences and propagation patterns
- **Post-Mortem Reasoning**: Provides ranked hypotheses about failure causes
- **Compiler-Aware**: Operates at module boundaries to survive torch.compile
- **Non-Invasive**: Wraps existing PyTorch training loops without code changes
- **Minimal API**: Focused on explanations, not raw data dumps

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install neuraldbg
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from neuraldbg import NeuralDbg

# Your existing model and training setup
model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(5, 1))
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Wrap your training loop
with NeuralDbg(model) as dbg:
    for step, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # Events are extracted automatically

# After training failure, query for explanations
explanations = dbg.explain_failure()
print(explanations[0])  # "Gradient vanishing originated in layer 'linear1' at step 234, likely due to LR × activation mismatch (confidence: 0.87)"
```

### Inference API

```python
# Get ranked causal hypotheses for the failure
hypotheses = dbg.get_causal_hypotheses()

# Query specific causal chains
chain = dbg.trace_causal_chain('vanishing_gradients')

# Check for coupled failures
couplings = dbg.detect_coupled_failures()
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Semantic Event Extractor**: Detects meaningful transitions in learning dynamics
- **Causal Compressor**: Identifies patterns and propagation in training failures
- **Post-Mortem Reasoner**: Generates ranked hypotheses about failure causes
- **Compiler-Aware Monitor**: Operates at safe boundaries for optimization compatibility

### Event Structure

Each semantic event represents:
- Transition type (gradient_health, activation_regime, optimizer_stability)
- Layer/parameter identifier
- Step range of occurrence
- Confidence score
- Causal metadata (propagation patterns, coupled failures)

## Target Users

- **ML Researchers** seeking causal explanations for training failures
- **PhD Students** analyzing learning dynamics in novel architectures
- **Research Engineers** understanding optimization instabilities

*Not intended for production monitoring, metric tracking, or no-code users.*

## Limitations (MVP Scope)

- PyTorch only
- Single causal question: "Why did gradients vanish here?"
- Focus on semantic events, not tensor inspection
- Command-line interface only
- Compiler-aware (torch.compile compatible)

## Contributing

This is an MVP focused on proving the concept of causal inference for training dynamics. Contributions should align with the core mission of providing structured explanations for training failures.
