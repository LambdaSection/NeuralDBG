# LinkedIn Post: Neural DSL v0.2.9 Release

� **Neural DSL v0.2.9 is now available**

We've just released Neural DSL v0.2.9, which includes code quality improvements and an experimental prototype of a visual design tool.

**What's in this release:**
- � **Code Quality Improvements**: Fixed trailing whitespace issues and missing newlines across the codebase
- 📝 **Documentation Updates**: Improved clarity in our documentation
- 🧪 **Experimental Aquarium Prototype**: Very early prototype of a visual tool for network design (available as a separate submodule)

The Aquarium prototype is extremely basic at this stage - it only supports a few layer types and has limited functionality. We're sharing it early to gather feedback on the direction.

Neural DSL continues to focus on providing a clean, readable syntax for defining neural networks in Python.

Try the latest version: `pip install neural-dsl==0.2.9`

We welcome your feedback on GitHub!
