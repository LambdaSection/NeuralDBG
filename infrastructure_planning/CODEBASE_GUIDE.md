This document is the entry point for anyone new to the NeuralDBG repository. Read this BEFORE touching any code.

## What is NeuralDBG?

NeuralDBG is a **causal inference engine for deep learning training dynamics**. It answers the question: *"Why did my model fail during training?"* -- not just *that* it failed.

It is NOT a traditional debugger. It does not pause execution or store tensors. Instead, it extracts **semantic events** (meaningful transitions like "gradients went from healthy to vanishing") and builds **causal hypotheses** ("this happened because of X, with 85% confidence").

## Key Files Explained

### neuraldbg.py (The Core Engine)
This is the Hub of the project. It contains:

| Class | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `EventType` | Enum of semantic events (gradient transitions, activation shifts, etc.) |
| `GradientHealth` | Enum of gradient states (healthy, vanishing, exploding, saturated) |
| `SemanticEvent` | A data structure representing a meaningful training transition |
| `CausalHypothesis` | A ranked explanation of why training failed |
| `NeuralDbg` | The main engine class. Wraps a PyTorch model with hooks to detect events |

**Key methods in `NeuralDbg`:**
- `__enter__` / `__exit__` : Context manager to wrap a training loop
- `_install_hooks` : Attaches PyTorch forward/backward hooks to every layer
- `_classify_gradient_health` : Categorizes a gradient norm as healthy/vanishing/exploding
- `_detect_gradient_transition` : Detects when gradient health changes between steps
- `explain_failure` : The main output -- returns ranked causal hypotheses
- `export_mermaid_causal_graph` : Generates a visual causal graph

### demo_vanishing_gradients.py (The Demo)
This is a self-contained script that:
1. Creates a deep Tanh network (prone to vanishing gradients by design)
2. Creates problematic data (small scale, small learning rate)
3. Trains the model inside a `NeuralDbg` context manager
4. Prints the causal hypotheses explaining why gradients vanished

**To run:** `python demo_vanishing_gradients.py`

## Key Concepts (Glossary)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Vanishing Gradients** | When gradients become so small that early layers stop learning. Common with Tanh/Sigmoid activations in deep networks. |
| **Exploding Gradients** | The opposite: gradients grow exponentially, causing numerical instability. |
| **Semantic Event** | A high-level, meaningful transition in training (NOT raw tensor data). Example: "gradient health changed from HEALTHY to VANISHING at step 42 in layer 3". |
| **Causal Hypothesis** | A ranked explanation of WHY a failure occurred, with confidence score and evidence chain. |
| **Hook (PyTorch)** | A callback function attached to a neural network layer that fires during forward or backward passes. NeuralDBG uses hooks to observe training without modifying the model code. |
| **Post-Mortem Analysis** | Analyzing training AFTER it finishes (not during). Like an autopsy for a failed training run. |
| **Causal Compression** | Reducing thousands of events into a small set of root causes. |

```

**For DevOps/MLOps:** Your work is in Spoke 3 (Infrastructure). You should NOT need to modify `neuraldbg.py` (the Hub). Your tasks involve wrapping the existing code with CI/CD, Docker, and experiment tracking.
