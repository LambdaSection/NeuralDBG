## Recommendations

### Priority Actions

1. **Fix test collection errors** - These prevent tests from running
2. **Investigate failing tests** - High failure rate needs attention
3. **Improve test coverage** - Add tests for uncovered code paths

### Next Steps

1. Review failing tests and fix bugs or update tests
2. Check coverage report for untested code paths
3. Add tests for new features or bug fixes
4. Re-run this script to track progress
